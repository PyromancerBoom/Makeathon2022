We talked a bit about it, for a single night only and after that she disappeared... she just disappeared...
It's... really heartbreaking, coming out is awful.

I’m sorry that your friendship ended. I know it’s heartbreaking to trust and be close to someone, just to have them leave you because of something you can’t control.
I believe this can be an opportunity for you to connect with allies of the queer community and queer people in general. It’s healthier to be around others that support you (or at least connect with).
Please don’t give up hope of having close friends. There are plenty of Muslims that are not against the queer community.
